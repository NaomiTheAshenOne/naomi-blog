&lt;p>For years residents of the UK have been getting fucked by internet service providers (ISPs), from extortionate pricing (10mbps down for Â£60 a month, what the hell BT X3), sketchy business practices, selling of user search data, internet censorship, making moving home more difficult and so much more, its safe to say I am not a giant fan off them as a whole ^^'&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But we &lt;em>need&lt;/em> access to the internet, so what can we really do about it&amp;hellip;?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The irremovable parasite of my life - Being reliant on phones</title><link>https://blog.naomitheashenone.moe/posts/the-irremovable-parasite-of-my-life/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 10:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://blog.naomitheashenone.moe/posts/the-irremovable-parasite-of-my-life/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.naomitheashenone.moe/the-irremoveable-parasite-of-my-life/thesesuck.png" alt="thumnail image">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-issue">What is the issue?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For as long as I can remember I have been using my phone for hours per day and at its worst there was a period of my life where I was spending 4-6 hours per day on social media. As you can imagine this is not good for a humans mental health ^^&amp;rsquo; and overtime I started to lower my consumption and removed social media apps one by one, at this point the only social media apps I have left if YouTube and Discord. Despite this my old habits remain strong and I still find myself using it more than I would like too&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
